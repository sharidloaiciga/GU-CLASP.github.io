We\nwill jointly choose a list of topics based on your interests and needs\nand for each topic we will agree on a reading list or a list of other\nresources (e.g. datasets and code) that will be considered. For each\ntopic you should prepare written work (a summary of readings, a\npractical programming implementation or experimental results) that\nwill then be discussed in a meeting. To get an overview of subject\n(and to pass the course) you should look at least 6 topics. You should\nalso complete a course project which should be of a quality of a\nworkshop paper that could be later submitted to a workshop or a\nconference.</p>\n<h2>Seminar course</h2>\n<p>If more students are taking the course, it will run as a seminar\nseries. We will jointly choose a list of topics based on students'\ninterests.  In order to pass this course, each student should\nparticipate in at least 12 seminars for which they should read a paper\n(or look at code and other resources) and participate in discussions,\nlead a discussion in least 4 seminars, and complete a course project\nwhich should be of a quality of a workshop paper that could be later\nsubmitted to a workshop or a conference.</p>\n<h2>With the masters course(s)</h2>\n<p>If this course has a corresponding masters course within the MLT\nprogramme and you have not taken it yet before, you can also follow\nits lectures, tutorials and labs. In order to pass this course, you\nshould attend the lectures, tutorials and labs of a corresponding\nmasters course, pass all its labs and complete a course project. Doing\nso you should exemplify a higher quality and sophistication of work,\nappropriate for the PhD level.

Generally, as this is a 7.5 HEC course\nit means that you would spend working on it for 5 weeks full-time or\n10 weeks half-time (60 HEC is 40 weeks).</p>\n<h2>Submission of work</h2>\n<p>Please submit your work through Github.
