We are pursuing the hypothesis that a\nrepresentation in this class is best expressed as an enriched\nstatistical language model that assigns probability values to the\nsentences of a language. A central part of the enrichment of the model\nconsists of a procedure for determining the acceptability\n(grammaticality) of a sentence as a graded value, relative to the\nproperties of that sentence and the language of which it is a part. This\nprocedure avoids the simple reduction of the grammaticality of a string\nto its probability of occurrence, while still characterizing\ngrammaticality in probabilistic terms. An enriched model of this kind\nwill provide a straightforward explanation for the fact that individual\nnative speakers generally judge the well formedness of sentences along a\ncontinuum, rather than through the imposition of a sharp boundary\nbetween acceptable and unacceptable sentences. The pervasiveness of\ngradedness in the linguistic knowledge of individual speakers poses a\nserious problem for classical theories of syntax, which partition\nstrings of words into the grammatical sentences of a language and ill\nformed strings of words.</p>\n<p>This research holds out the prospect of important impact in two areas.\nFirst, it can shed light on the relationship between the representation\nand acquisition of linguistic knowledge on one hand, and learning and\nthe encoding of knowledge in other cognitive domains. This work can, in\nturn, help to clarify the respective roles of biologically conditioned\nlearning biases and data driven learning in human cognition.</p>\n<p>Second, this work can contribute to the development of more effective\nlanguage technology by providing insight, from a computational\nperspective, into the way in which humans represent the syntactic\nproperties of sentences in their language. To the extent that natural\nlanguage processing systems take account of this class of\nrepresentations they will provide more efficient tools for parsing and\ninterpreting text and speech.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Professor","name":"Shalom Lappin","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/9b4bba473639fff2a4121009cb4e9857/shalomlappin.jpg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/people/shalom-lappin/projects/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/people/shalom-lappin/projects/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
