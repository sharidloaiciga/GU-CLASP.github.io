My tasks involve (among other things), arranging travel and appointments, updating the CLASP website, handling invoices, purchases, conference and guest research administration.</p>\n<p>Prior I have worked mostly with economy administration, both in the state and private sector.</p>\n<p>I am a communicative and positive person, with a great interest in languages, other people and cultures. An interest I have had for as long as I can remember. Possibly coming from being raised in a bilingual family, with both Swedish and Finnish as native languages...</p>\n<p>My interest in languages has led me to a lot of language studies and trips both here in Sweden as abroad. Most recently, three years at the Gothenburg University and the International Language Program with a Spanish orientation. The goal after the studies were to get an employment within the GU where I could combine my language and administrative knowledges and skills; which I gratefully managed!</p>\n<p>You are most welcome to contact me, in Finnish, Spanish, English or, if you prefer, in good, old Swedish ;-) :-)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Administrator","name":"Susanna Myyry","profileImage":{"publicURL":"/static/f46d4899b81efce7d1320544f49d7ebd/susanna-myyry.jpg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/people/susanna-myyry/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/people/susanna-myyry/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
