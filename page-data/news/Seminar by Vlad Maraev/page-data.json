We argue that linear logic is the natural formalism to implement information-state dialogue management.  We give particular attention to modelling question-answering sequences, including clarification requests, and argue that metavariables, arising from unification in the proof search, play a decisive role in providing a natural\nformalisation.</p>\n<p>We show that our framework is not only well suited from a theoretical\nperspective, but it is also suitable for implementation which we\nexemplify with a small scale implementation.</p>\n<p>(joint work with Jean-Philippe Bernardy and Jonathan Ginzburg)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar by Vlad Maraev from University of Gothenburg","date":"February 24, 2021","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Vlad Maraev/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Vlad Maraev/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
