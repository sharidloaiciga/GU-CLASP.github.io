In this task, one player (the Architect) needs to instruct another (the Builder) via a chat interface to construct a given target structure that only the Architect is shown. Although humans easily complete this task (often after lengthy back-and-forth dialogue), creating agents for each of this role poses a number of challenges for current NLP technologies. To understand these challenges, I will describe the dataset we have collected for this task, as well as the models that we have developed for both roles.\"</p>\n<p>Julia Hockenmaier is an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
