Existing research is comprised of a few end-to-end attempts as well as combinations of solutions to one or more of the subtasks. To determine which is the best end-to-end solution, one must combine models solving individual or combinations of subtasks with one another.  As I set out, I found myself with code in different languages and different code bases. I saw an opportunity to unify the existing research into a single Python framework not only to create a better setting for experiments but also to make research in Argument Mining easier and more accessible.</p>\n<p>This tool includes preprocessing, feature extraction, deep learning training setup, SOTA models, visualisations, experiment and model logging, and other features.</p>\n<p>In this seminar, I will introduce you to Argument Mining, its challenges and my framework for Argument Mining;  HotAm\nTime: 13.15-15.00</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar by Axel Almquist from University of Gothenburg","date":"February 03, 2021","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Axel Almquist/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Axel Almquist/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
