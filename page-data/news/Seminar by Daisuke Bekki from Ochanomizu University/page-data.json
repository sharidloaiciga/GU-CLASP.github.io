I will mainly focus on the end-to-end RTE system \"ccg2lambda\", which we developed in 2015, that integrates CCG parsers, formal semantics, higher-order theorem provers, and machine learning.  I will also discuss some extensions of ccg2lambda to the tasks such as visual-textual entailment and semantic textual similarity.</p>\n<p>Time: 13.15-15.00</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar by Daisuke Bekki from Ochanomizu University","date":"November 17, 2020","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Daisuke Bekki from Ochanomizu University/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Daisuke Bekki from Ochanomizu University/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
