However, there is still significant room for corpora that increase the complexity of both visual and linguistic domains and which capture different varieties. In this talk, I will present work extending the ARRAU (Uryupina et al., 2020) annotation scheme to account for the situated dialog genre. This annotation scheme covers a broad range of referential phenomena and is compatible with the textual task of coreference resolution. I will mention some of the open questions regarding the semantics of reference and annotation, but also the opportunities that such annotation offers.\"</p>\n<p>Time: 13.15-15.00</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar by Sharid Loáiciga from University of Potsdam","date":"August 25, 2021","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Sharid Loáiciga/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Sharid Loáiciga/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
