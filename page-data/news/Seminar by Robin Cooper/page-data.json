Two key aspects of this are:\nDynamic processing -- witnesses can be added to types during computation (meant to be useful for agents observing new objects and making judgements about their types) and witness conditions can be added to a type during computation (meant to be useful for agents engaging in a learning process and refining the definition of a type on the fly).\nTypes as an interface to an extra-typetheoretical world -- witness conditions for types can call on arbitrary external modules which need not be implemented in pyttr, for example, classifiers created by standard machine-learning techniques.</p>\n<p>In non-probabilistic pyttr, objects which have been judged to be witnesses for a type are stored in a witness cache for that type. In probabilistic pyttr objects which have been judged for a type are stored in the witness cache paired together with a probability interval, [n,m], indicating that the object is judged to be of the type with minimum probability n and maximum probability m. One interesting consequence of this is that we can store a negative judgement of an object (i.e. paired with the interval [0,0]). Also \"Don't know\" results ([0,1]) can be returned (since all probabilities are between 0 and 1).</p>\n<p>In the talk I will go through some of the examples in the probttr notebook cited above and discuss some of the questions that this approach raises -- to which I suspect the audience may have different answers than those which I have assumed in the implementation...\"</p>\n<p>Time: 13.15-15.00</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar by Robin Cooper from University of Gothenburg","date":"April 14, 2021","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Robin Cooper/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Robin Cooper/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
