As NLP systems become more ubiquitous in our daily lives through technologies like Google Translate and Appleâ€™s Siri, it is important to develop methods that provide insight into understanding the reasoning capabilities of these systems. I will cover my work on developing diagnostic test-suites composed of fine-grained semantic phenomena. With remaining time, I will highlight some recent work in the community applying RTE as an evaluation method to downstream NLP models.\"</p>\n<p>Time: 14.00-15.45</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar by Adam Poliak from Barnard College","date":"June 09, 2021","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Adam Poliak/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Adam Poliak/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
