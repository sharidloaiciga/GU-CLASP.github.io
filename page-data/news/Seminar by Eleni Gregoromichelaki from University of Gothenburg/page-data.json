I\npresent a view of syntactic processing as sensorimotor skills developed to grasp reliable actionperception\nregularities. Under this view, natural language elements like words and syntactic\nstructures can be subsumed in models of affordances, properties of social settings [Heft, 1989]\nrelative to (groups of) human agents who can explore or exploit them to gain access to these\nsettings. I will present the formal architecture of a syntactic model (DS, Kempson et al. [2001])\nthat provides a way of capturing (joint) linguistic and physical actions by relying on the goaldirected,\npredictive nature of cognition.</p>\n<p>Since linguistic phenomena also show that there is continuity between low-level “syntactic”\nand conceptual mechanisms, I will address various ways to unify DS with TTR (Cooper\n[2012], in prep) under a single formalism. In my view, TTR types, like syntactic DS types,\ncan also be modelled as affordances, namely, real features of the sociocultural environment that\nare, nevertheless, defined relative to agents’ abilities and preferences. Standard TTR types are\nthen abstract, higher level goal macrostates, referring to a (potentially) infinite set of low-level\nstate graphs probabilistically accessible to agents in a particular context. From this point of\nview, judgements are not assignments of type labels to entities but, instead, the pursuance of\naffordances, action policies, in interactions.</p>\n<p>Time: 13.15-15.00</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Joint CLASP and Linguistics seminar by Eleni Gregoromichelaki from University of Gothenburg","date":"November 16, 2020","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Eleni Gregoromichelaki from University of Gothenburg/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Eleni Gregoromichelaki from University of Gothenburg/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
