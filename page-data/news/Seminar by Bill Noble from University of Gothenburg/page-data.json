They have also been used extensively to study long-term lexical semantic change. In this talk, I will discuss the use of distributional semantics to study more short-term semantic change, as well as variation between speech communities. I will present results from two recent studies and compare the merits of using word vectors from a diachronic Skip-Gram model versus conditional neural language models.\"</p>\n<p>Time: 13.15-15.00</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Seminar by Bill Noble from University of Gothenburg","date":"January 27, 2021","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Bill Noble from University of Gothenburg/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Bill Noble from University of Gothenburg/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
