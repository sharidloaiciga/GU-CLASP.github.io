At one extreme, some languages have a small set of number terms, which denote approximate or inexact numerosities; at the other extreme, many languages have forms for exact numerosities over a very large range, through a recursively defined counting system. Why do numeral systems vary as they do? An influential proposal has suggested that this arises from  a functional need for efficient communication and framed it in an information-theoretic setting. Here we adopt a machine learning perspective and show that a simple reinforcement learning mechanism produces numeral systems with properties very similar to human systems of similar complexity. </p>\n<p>Time: 13.15-15.00</p>\n<p>Location: via Zoom, <a href=\"https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09\">https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/63017385241?pwd=NEdYMkRCUnRUTVQ4UUtuUTM3aDdEUT09</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Joint seminar by Emil Carlsson and Devdatt Dubhashi from University of Gothenburg, Chalmers","date":"November 04, 2020","bannerImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c9af1a4d3ace5757c1e05c398aa48acd/meeting-311355_1280.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Emil Carlsson and Devdatt Dubhashi from University of Gothenburg, Chalmers/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/Seminar by Emil Carlsson and Devdatt Dubhashi from University of Gothenburg, Chalmers/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
