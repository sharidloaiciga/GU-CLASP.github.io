Because of this, the system does not satisfactorily interpret propositional attitude verbs (believe, know, etc.), a fact which has motivated the development of 'hyperintensional' logics.</p>\n<p>I will discuss a hyperintensional system which naturally incorporates the intensional logic of Montague with the usual notions of homotopy type theory (HoTT). This system is based on a fragment of Shulman (2018). From HoTT, we inherit two notions of equality, Â¿ and =, which we think of as expressing intensional and extensional equalities, respectively. From Montague, we inherit a syntax for intensional operators, which for us will, however, mean operators which respect intensional but not (necessarily) extensional equality. These are used to interpret propositional attitude operators.</p>\n<p>This approach is in the tradition of other linguistically-motivated systems with two notions of equality (Thomason 1980, Fox and Lappin 2008). Some advantages are that it allows a treatment of de re belief, and inherits a nice model theory from HoTT.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Propositional Attitude Operators via Homotopy Type Theory","lecturer":"Colin Zwanziger","duration":"2 hours","date":"30 Oct, 2019","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/f61836fb0b50976bcae74ff1e2372eef/1759745_zwanziger-colin-clasp-19.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2019-10-30/Colin-Zwanziger-Propositional/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2019-10-30/Colin-Zwanziger-Propositional/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
