Two key aspects of this are: Dynamic processing -- witnesses can be added to types during computation (meant to be useful for agents observing new objects and making judgements about their types) and witness conditions can be added to a type during computation (meant to be useful for agents engaging in a learning process and refining the definition of a type on the fly). Types as an interface to an extra-typetheoretical world -- witness conditions for types can call on arbitrary external modules which need not be implemented in pyttr, for example, classifiers created by standard machine-learning techniques.</p>\n<p>In non-probabilistic pyttr, objects which have been judged to be witnesses for a type are stored in a witness cache for that type. In probabilistic pyttr objects which have been judged for a type are stored in the witness cache paired together with a probability interval, [n,m], indicating that the object is judged to be of the type with minimum probability n and maximum probability m. One interesting consequence of this is that we can store a negative judgement of an object (i.e. paired with the interval [0,0]). Also \"Don't know\" results ([0,1]) can be returned (since all probabilities are between 0 and 1).</p>\n<p>In the talk I will go through some of the examples in the probttr notebook cited above and discuss some of the questions that this approach raises -- to which I suspect the audience may have different answers than those which I have assumed in the implementation...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Types and probability: Implementing probabilistic TTR","lecturer":"Robin Cooper","duration":"2 hours","date":"14 Apr, 2021","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/4ffedeca424dd6774b00ff6ce8268a06/typprob-slides.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-04-14/Robin-Cooper/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-04-14/Robin-Cooper/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
