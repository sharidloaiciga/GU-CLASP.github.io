At one extreme, some languages have a small set of number terms, which denote approximate or inexact numerosities; at the other extreme, many languages have forms for exact numerosities over a very large range, through a recursively defined counting system. Why do numeral systems vary as they do? An influential proposal has suggested that this arises from a functional need for efficient communication and framed it in an information-theoretic setting. Here we adopt a machine learning perspective and show that a simple reinforcement learning mechanism produces numeral systems with properties very similar to human systems of similar complexity. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learning numeral systems by interaction","lecturer":"Emil Carlsson and Devdatt Dubhashi ","duration":"2 hours","date":"04 Nov, 2020","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/a6ad2af99169bbcb82ccba96a72f184b/Emil Carlsson and Devdatt Dubhashi 4.11.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-11-04/Emil-Carlsson-and-Devdatt Dubhashi/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-11-04/Emil-Carlsson-and-Devdatt Dubhashi/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
