We argue that linear logic is the natural formalism to implement information-state dialogue management. We give particular attention to modelling question-answering sequences, including clarification requests, and argue that metavariables, arising from unification in the proof search, play a decisive role in providing a natural formalisation.</p>\n<p>We show that our framework is not only well suited from a theoretical perspective, but it is also suitable for implementation which we exemplify with a small scale implementation.</p>\n<p>(joint work with Jean-Philippe Bernardy and Jonathan Ginzburg)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dialogue management with linear logic: the role of metavariables in questions and clarifications","lecturer":"Vlad Maraev","duration":"2 hours","date":"24 Feb, 2021","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/3767b185ae03e494dd7d2efc72f0bded/slides-tal.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-02-24/Vlad-Maraev/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-02-24/Vlad-Maraev/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
