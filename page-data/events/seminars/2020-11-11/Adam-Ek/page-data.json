In our paper, we evaluate four different methods of obtaining word representations for morphological sequence classification, that is, the task of assigning grammatical features to words. Our experiments reveal that using an RNN to compute word representations is consistently more effective than the other three methods across a sample of eight languages with different typology and varying number of byte-pair tokens per word.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Composing Byte-Pair Encodings for Morphological Sequence Classification","lecturer":"Adam Ek","duration":"2 hours","date":"11 Nov, 2020","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/de44a7f6d0e0dd73ca35689252b7df39/Adam Ek 11.11.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-11-11/Adam-Ek/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-11-11/Adam-Ek/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
