As Grice (1975) put it, \"Talking [is] a special case or variety of purposive, indeed rational behavior.\" But what does it mean for a behavior to be rational? I will contrast two notions of rationality as they have been applied to language use, one cooperative (aÌ€ la Grice) and the other interactive, and argue that both are legitimate. I will show how the interactive model, based on one type of rationality, accounts for a wide range of phenomena that are complementary for those accounted for in a Gricean cooperative model. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On the rational basis of communication","lecturer":"Herbert H.
