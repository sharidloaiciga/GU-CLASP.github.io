As such, the Quran has become susceptible to misinterpretation ---intentional or otherwise---in human-articulated statements citing Quranic verses. This can also be attributed to the fact that Quranic verses have a high level of linguistic sophistication. For example, metaphors are often used in the Quran, especially as a means for persuasion. In our work, we seek to determine how close a human-articulated statement is to its cited Quranic verse. To this end, we are developing an approach based on the measurement of semantic similarity between any given pair of texts: a human-articulated statement and a verse from what is considered as a gold standard English version of the Quran. Specifically, we are automatically detecting metaphors in the statements, with the aim of assessing whether they are correct translations. As a supporting resource for development and evaluation, we are leveraging a manually annotated corpus consisting of 300 pairs of statements and verses.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Detecting semantic similarity between human-articulated statements and Quranic verses","lecturer":"Riza Batista","duration":"2 hours","date":"19 Dec, 2018","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/e3948a2efbf40270c10b624c188f8e62/1711230_clasp-seminar-dec-2018---riza-batista.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-12-19/Riza-Batista-Detecting/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-12-19/Riza-Batista-Detecting/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
