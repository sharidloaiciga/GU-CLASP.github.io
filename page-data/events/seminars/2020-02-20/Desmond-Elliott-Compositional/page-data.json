We study the problem of compositional generalization, which measures how well a model composes unseen combinations of concepts when describing images. State-of-the-art image captioning models show poor generalization performance on this task. We propose a multi-task model to address the poor performance, that combines caption generation and image--sentence ranking, and uses a decoding mechanism that re-ranks the captions according their similarity to the image. This model is substantially better at generalizing to unseen combinations of concepts compared to state-of-the-art captioning models.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Compositional Generalization in Image Captioning","lecturer":"Desmond Elliott","duration":"2 hours","date":"20 Feb, 2020","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/0b5265cf5566a3d774bedd01b62baa47/1765667_desmond-elliott---compositional-generalisation-in-image-captioning.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-02-20/Desmond-Elliott-Compositional/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-02-20/Desmond-Elliott-Compositional/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
