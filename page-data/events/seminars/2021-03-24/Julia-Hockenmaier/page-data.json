In this talk, I will present work done by my group on defining a collaborative Blocks World construction task in Minecraft. In this task, one player (the Architect) needs to instruct another (the Builder) via a chat interface to construct a given target structure that only the Architect is shown. Although humans easily complete this task (often after lengthy back-and-forth dialogue), creating agents for each of this role poses a number of challenges for current NLP technologies. To understand these challenges, I will describe the dataset we have collected for this task, as well as the models that we have developed for both roles.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Collaborative Construction and Communication with Minecraft","lecturer":"Julia Hockenmaier","duration":"2 hours","date":"24 Mar, 2021","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/4b4fef3e35a0b37b7a3400b8f26c05b9/HockenmaierMinecraftNEW.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-03-24/Julia-Hockenmaier/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-03-24/Julia-Hockenmaier/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
