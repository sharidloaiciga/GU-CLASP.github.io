In this talk I'll present an on-going work on rumour detection; particularly, we are interested in understanding how <em>early</em> we can detect them. Although there are numerous studies on rumour detection, few are concerned with the timing of the detection. A successfully-detected malicious rumour can still cause significant damage if it isn't detected in a timely manner, and so timing is crucial. To address this, we present a novel methodology for early rumour detection. Our model treats social media posts (e.g. tweets) as a data stream and integrates reinforcement learning to learn the number minimum number of posts required before we classify an event as a rumour. Experiments on Twitter and Weibo demonstrate that our model identifies rumours earlier than state-of-the-art systems while maintaining a comparable accuracy.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Early rumour detection","lecturer":"Jey Han Lau,","duration":"2 hours","date":"29 Mar, 2019","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/cf36d98279dbd71f2e4f0e0b37f86c79/1723742_rumour.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2019-03-29/Jey-Han-Lau,-Early/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2019-03-29/Jey-Han-Lau,-Early/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
