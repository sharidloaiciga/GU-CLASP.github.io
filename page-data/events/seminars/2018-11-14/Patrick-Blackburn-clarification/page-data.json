First, I will motivate the hypothesis in theoretical, practical and empirical terms and formulate it as a concrete Clarification Potential Principle: implicatures may become explicit as fourth-level clarification requests. Second, I will present a framework for generating the clarification potential of an instruction by inferring its conversational implicatures with respect to a particular context. I will discuss the evaluation of the framework, illustrate its performance using a human-human corpus of situated conversations, and argue that much of the inference required can be handled using classical planning.</p>\n<p>This talk is based on joint work with Luciana Benotti of Logic, Interaction and Intelligent Systems Group, Universidad Nacional de CoÃÅrdoba, Argentina.</p>\n<p>Many of the main ideas can be found in the paper: Modeling the clarification potential of instructions: Predicting clarification requests and other reactions, by Luciana Benotti and Patrick Blackburn, Computer Speech &#x26; Language 45: 536-551 (2017)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The clarification potential of instructions: Predicting clarification requests","lecturer":"Patrick Blackburn","duration":"2 hours","date":"14 Nov, 2018","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":null},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-11-14/Patrick-Blackburn-clarification/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-11-14/Patrick-Blackburn-clarification/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
