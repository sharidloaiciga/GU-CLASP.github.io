However, the underlying process remains incompletely understood and actively debated. In the talk, I will present a computationally explicit account of this process and the emerging representation of sentence meaning. We simulate N400 amplitudes as the change induced by an incoming stimulus in an implicit and probabilistic representation of meaning captured by the hidden unit activation pattern in a neural network model of sentence comprehension, and we propose that the process underlying the N400 also drives implicit learning in the network. The model provides a unified account of 16 distinct findings from the N400 literature.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Modeling the N400 brain potential as change in a probabilistic representation of meaning","lecturer":"Milena Rabovsky","duration":"2 hours","date":"28 May, 2020","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/99f6c89fba43bf71cedf1d4377869bad/1772978_talk_gothenburg_milena_rabovsky.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-05-28/Milena-Rabovsky-Modeling/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-05-28/Milena-Rabovsky-Modeling/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
