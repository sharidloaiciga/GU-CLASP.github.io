Making use of a normalization result for the system, we shall propose a proof-theoretic semantics for the intensional operators for intuitionistic belief and knowledge which explains their meaning entirely by appeal to the structure of derivations. Since the system enjoys the subexpression property, a refinement of the subformula property, it is fully analytic. We will also compare this approach to the logic and semantics of belief and knowledge with other intuitionistic approaches.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Intuitionistic multi-agent subatomic natural deduction for belief and knowledge","lecturer":"Bartosz Wieckowski","duration":"2 hours","date":"21 Nov, 2018","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/3a8a833f2cce60596845fcd375143f39/1708035_2018_gothenburg_clasp_slides.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-11-21/Bartosz-Wieckowski-Intuitionistic/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-11-21/Bartosz-Wieckowski-Intuitionistic/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
