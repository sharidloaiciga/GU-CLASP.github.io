In this talk, I will first of all present the evidence that convinced us that the assumption that a single interpretation can always be assigned to anaphoric expression is no more than a convenient idealization. I will then discuss recent work on the DALI project that aims to develop a new model of interpretation that abandons this assumption for the case of anaphoric interpretation/coreference. I will present the recently released Phrase Detectives 2.1 corpus, containing around 2 million crowdsourced judgements for more than 100,000 markable, an average of 20 judgements per markable; the Mention Pair Annotation (MPA) Bayesian inference model developed to aggregate these judgements; and the results of a preliminary analysis of disagreements in the corpus suggesting that between 10&#x26; % and 30% of marbles in the corpus appear to be genuinely ambiguous.</p>\n<p>Joint work with Jon Chamberlain, Silviu Paun, Alexandra Uma, Juntago Yu, Derya Cokal, Janosch Haber, Richard Bartle and Udo Kruschwitz.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Disagreements in Anaphoric Interpretation","lecturer":"Massimo Poesio,","duration":"2 hours","date":"10 Apr, 2019","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/5849995d753ba3c2e05f43bd8f84b5a4/1724686_massimo-poesio_disagreements-in-anaphoric-annotation.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2019-04-10/Massimo-Poesio,-Disagreements/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2019-04-10/Massimo-Poesio,-Disagreements/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
