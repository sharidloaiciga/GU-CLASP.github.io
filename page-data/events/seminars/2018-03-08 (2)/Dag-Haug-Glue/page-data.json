The UD tree is rewritten as meaning constructors consisting of a lambda term over DRSs and a linear logic formula that guides the semantic composition. Unlike many other frameworks, Glue semantics does not presuppose a one-to-one mapping from syntax to semantics, which is useful when dealing with highly underspecified syntactic representations of the UD kind.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Glue semantics for Universal dependencies","lecturer":"Dag Haug","duration":"2 hours","date":"08 Mar, 2018","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/b4694914c574703fa77a07140f339f32/1685343_gothamhaug.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-03-08 (2)/Dag-Haug-Glue/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-03-08 (2)/Dag-Haug-Glue/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
