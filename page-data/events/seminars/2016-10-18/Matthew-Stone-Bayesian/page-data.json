To learn meanings from data, we therefore need to link underlying representations of meaning to models of speaker judgment and speaker choice. This paper describes a new approach to this problem: we model variability through uncertainty in categorization boundaries and distributions over preferred vocabulary. We apply the approach to a large data set of color descriptions, where statistical evaluation documents its accuracy. The results are available as a Lexicon of Uncertain Color Standards (LUX), which supports future efforts in grounded language understanding and generation by probabilistically mapping 829 English color descriptions to potentially context-sensitive regions in HSV color space.</p>\n<p>joint work with Brian McMahan.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Bayesian model of grounded color semantics","lecturer":"Matthew Stone","duration":"2 hours","date":"18 Oct, 2016","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/f42e209c1ecbd21a304966d54be92b61/1595352_matthewstone.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2016-10-18/Matthew-Stone-Bayesian/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2016-10-18/Matthew-Stone-Bayesian/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
