This is due to the unique features of MTTs: they contain rich type structures that provide powerful representational means (e.g., to represent collections as types) and, at the same time, are specified proof-theoretically as rule-based systems whose sentences (judgements) can be understood inferentially.</p>\n<p>Considered in this way, MTTs arguably have promising advantages when employed as foundational languages for formal semantics, both theoretically and practically.</p>\n<p>Lecturer: </p>\n<p>Zhaohui Luo is a Professor of Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MTT-semantics Is Both Model-theoretic and Proof-theoretic","lecturer":"Zhaohui Luo","duration":"2 hours","date":"27 Apr, 2016","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/4ec15471bf4ea410eeece4b8f90c4520/1573554_zhaohui_luo_clasp_seminar.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2016-04-27/Zhaohui-Luo-MTT-semantics/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2016-04-27/Zhaohui-Luo-MTT-semantics/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
