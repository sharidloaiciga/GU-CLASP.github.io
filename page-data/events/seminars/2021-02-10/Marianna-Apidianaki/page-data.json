In our work, we explore the knowledge BERT encodes about lexical semantics. We specifically probe BERT representations for lexical polysemy detection, scalar adjective ranking and noun property prediction. We perform intrinsic evaluations against hand-crafted data, and test the extracted representations on the tasks of indirect question-answering and in-context lexical entailment. We show that the model encodes rich information about polysemy and adjective intensity, acquired through pre-training, but has only marginal knowledge of noun properties and their prevalence.</p>\n<p>The presented work has been performed in collaboration with my PhD student, Aina Gar√≠ Soler (University Paris-Saclay), in the frame of the MULTISEM ANR project.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What does BERT know about words?
