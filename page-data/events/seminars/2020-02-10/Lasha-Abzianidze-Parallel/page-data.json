Two main principles underlying the PMB are (i) a meaning-preserving property of translations and (ii) compositionality of meaning. The meaning-preserving principle drives formal meaning representations of translations to the same representation. At the same time, the compositionality principle reduces modelling of phrase semantics to modelling of lexical semantics. While the modelling of lexical semantics is still a challenge, the shift to the lexical level enables us to project formal meaning representations from a pivot language to other languages. This is a very attractive idea, but it faces enormous challenges. How did we deal with them? In the presentation, I will describe the annotation layers of the PMB, a pipeline of NLP tools, and its online annotation environment.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Parallel Meaning Bank: a corpus of translations annotated with formal meaning representations","lecturer":"Lasha Abzianidze","duration":"2 hours","date":"10 Feb, 2020","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/2ea7cd1846e43062c88abd1973c5d6ad/1766301_lasha-abzianidze---pmb_at_claps---10.02.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-02-10/Lasha-Abzianidze-Parallel/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-02-10/Lasha-Abzianidze-Parallel/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
