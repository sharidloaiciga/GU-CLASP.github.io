They are used in the modeling of many problems, mostly prominently in syntax and semantics. Latent-variable grammars are an extension of vanilla probabilistic grammars, introducing latent variables that inject additional information into the grammar by using learning algorithms in the incomplete data setting.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will discuss work aimed at the development of (four) theoretically-motivated algorithms for the estimation of latent-variable grammars. I will discuss how we applied them to syntactic parsing, and more semantically-oriented problems such as machine translation, conversation modeling in online forums and question answering.</p>\n<p>Lecturer:Shay Cohen is a Chancellor's Fellow at the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation, University of Edinburgh.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Latent-Variable Grammars and Natural Language Semantics","lecturer":"Shay Cohen","duration":"2 hours","date":"04 May, 2016","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/8a00a747550516ac358482490f5dfb42/1573536_shay_cohen_clasp_seminar.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2016-05-04/Shay-Cohen-Latent-Variable/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2016-05-04/Shay-Cohen-Latent-Variable/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
