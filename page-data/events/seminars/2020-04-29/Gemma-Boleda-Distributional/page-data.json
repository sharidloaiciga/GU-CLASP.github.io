In this talk, I will present methods and results in distributional semantics that are of relevance for theoretical linguistics, in three areas: semantic change, polysemy and composition, and the grammar-semantics interface (specifically, the interface of semantics with syntax, on the one hand, and with derivational morphology, on the other). Talk based on the following paper: Boleda, G. 2020. Distributional Semantics and Linguistic Theory. Annual Review of Linguistics, Vol. 6: 213-23.
