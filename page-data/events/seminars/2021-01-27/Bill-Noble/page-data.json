They have also been used extensively to study long-term lexical semantic change. In this talk, I will discuss the use of distributional semantics to study more short-term semantic change, as well as variation between speech\ncommunities. I will present results from two recent studies and compare the merits of using word vectors from a diachronic Skip-Gram model versus conditional neural language models.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Distributional semantics for lexical variation and change","lecturer":"Bill Noble","duration":"2 hours","date":"27 Jan, 2021","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/5d64f9eeefe243e13b866fadc748ef4d/dist-variation-and-change-slides.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-01-27/Bill-Noble/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-01-27/Bill-Noble/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
