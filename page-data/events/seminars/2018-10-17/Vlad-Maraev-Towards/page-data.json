We utilise our own proof-theoretic implementation of Type Theory with Records (TTR) and implement a basis dialogue that involves mutual greeting. We emphasize the importance of findings in dialogue theory for designing dialogue systems which we illustrate by sketching an account for question-answer relevance.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Towards KoS/TTR-based proof-theoretic dialogue management (joint work with: Jonathan Ginzburg (UniversiteÃÅ Paris Diderot), Staffan Larsson, Ye Tian (Amazon Research), Jean-Philippe Bernardy)","lecturer":"Vlad Maraev","duration":"2 hours","date":"17 Oct, 2018","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/0e8e41f49889bdf2e00e323ec673f557/1705644_slides-vlad-clasp.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-10-17/Vlad-Maraev-Towards/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-10-17/Vlad-Maraev-Towards/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
