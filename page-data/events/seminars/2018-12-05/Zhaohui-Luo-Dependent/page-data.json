We consider dependent event types indexed by thematic roles (DETs) and illustrate how, in the presence of refined event types, subtyping plays an essential role in semantic interpretations.</p>\n<p>Two applications of DETs are studied. The first shows that DETs give a natural solution to an incompatibility problem (sometimes called event quantification problem) in combining event semantics with the traditional compositional semantics. The second concerns selectional restriction: it is shown that DETs offer flexible but nice treatments of selectional restriction in the MTT-semantic setting with events.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dependent Event Types","lecturer":"Zhaohui Luo","duration":"2 hours","date":"05 Dec, 2018","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/020ca017a5b4024c0de1386fa3fa4ecd/1709739_clasp18event.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-12-05/Zhaohui-Luo-Dependent/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2018-12-05/Zhaohui-Luo-Dependent/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
