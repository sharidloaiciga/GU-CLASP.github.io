Existing research is comprised of a few end-to-end attempts as well as combinations of solutions to one or more of the subtasks. To determine which is the best end-to-end solution, one must combine models solving individual or combinations of subtasks with one another. As I set out, I found myself with code in different languages and different code bases. I saw an opportunity to unify the existing research into a single Python framework not only to create a better setting for experiments but also to make research in Argument Mining easier and more accessible.</p>\n<p>This tool includes preprocessing, feature extraction, deep learning training setup, SOTA models, visualisations, experiment and model logging, and other features.</p>\n<p>In this seminar, I will introduce you to Argument Mining, its challenges and my framework for Argument Mining; HotAm.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"HotAM: an Argument Mining Framework","lecturer":"Axel Almquist","duration":"2 hours","date":"03 Feb, 2021","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/bc297d41827c21131560eea3f130c803/HotAM-presentation-slides.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-02-03/Axel-Almquist/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2021-02-03/Axel-Almquist/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
