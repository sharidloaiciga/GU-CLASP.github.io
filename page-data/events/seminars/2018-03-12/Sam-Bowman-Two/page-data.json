The first project (based partially on WIlliams et al. 2017) concerns latent tree learning: efforts to discover the optimal tree structures for use in guiding semantic composition for applied language understanding tasks. The second concerns the evaluation of simple neural network models on the classic linguistic acceptability judgments task. This project (in progress, with Alex Warstadt) builds on Lau, Clark, and Lappin '16, and introduces a new dataset of expert acceptability judgments and a new suite of semi-supervised learning experiments with neural networks.</p>\n<p>ReferencesWilliams, Adina, Andrew Drozdov, and Samuel R.
