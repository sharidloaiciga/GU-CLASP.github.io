I will mainly focus on the end-to-end RTE system \"ccg2lambda\", which we developed in 2015, that integrates CCG parsers, formal semantics, higher-order theorem provers, and machine learning. I will also discuss some extensions of ccg2lambda to the tasks such as visual-textual entailment and semantic textual similarity.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A hybrid approach toward Natural Language Understanding","lecturer":"Daisuke Bekki","duration":"2 hours","date":"09 Dec, 2020","venue":"Gothenburg","slides":{"publicURL":"/static/a7204beb0b21542ef2f348e0e5465b44/Daisuke Bekki 9.12.pdf"}},"fields":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-12-09/Daisuke-Bekki/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/events/seminars/2020-12-09/Daisuke-Bekki/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3875542623"]}
