My research aims at improving dialogue between humans and machines. I position my research in a field of computational linguistics in a broad sense: I build models that reproduce human behaviour, therefore trying to understand how our cognition works. And one of the by-products of this is, I believe, a better AI.

You can find more about my work as well as a list of publications on my personal [webpage](https://maraev.me/).
