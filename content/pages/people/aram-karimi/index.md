I’m a researcher and programmer at CLASP. I did my master at Artificial Intelligente and Computer Science. My research focuses on deep learning and machine learning, especially in NLP fields. I’d like to study about multi task learning, dynamic learning, Computational cognitive science and neurosciences. 
Now I’m working on text recommendation using Deep Neural Network. This approach combines metrics of traditional collaborative filtering and Deep learning modelings.
